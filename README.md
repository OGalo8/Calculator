# Calculator

A simple calculator using JS,CSS,HTML

<!--  -->

The HTML/CSS mockup has been completed. Will need more styling, but that will be done after completing functionality.

<!--  -->

Added logic to show on display numbers, erase screen and change signs.

By multiplying by -1 when changing signs, JS is converting the entered string to a number!!!

<!--  -->

Basic functionality is now complete.

Will now add logic to:

- Prevent using more than one decimal point per digit.
- Prevent using more than one operation per calculation (limiting the lenght of the array so it executes the calculations when lenght == 3 might help)
- Add functionality to the % button
- Toggle button color (maybe there is already an option for this. All colors should reset with reboot function)
- Show only 2 decimal places per result.
- Limit the maximum number of digits available OR reduce the size of the font in the display
