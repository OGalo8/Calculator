# Calculator

A simple calculator using JS,CSS,HTML

<!--  -->

The HTML/CSS mockup has been completed. Will need more styling, but that will be done after completing functionality.

<!--  -->

Added logic to show on display numbers, erase screen and change signs.

By multiplying by -1 when changing signs, JS is converting the entered string to a number!!!

<!--  -->

Basic functionality is now complete.

Will now add logic to:

- Toggle button color (maybe there is already an option for this. All colors should reset with reboot function)
- Limit the maximum number of digits available OR reduce the size of the font in the display.
- eliminate BUG in the +/- sign after pressing an operation button
- Add a backspace button :,v
- Add keyboard support
- show 0. when pressing point after an equal or if no number has been pressed.
- Modify span (screen) styling when the digits are too large, so results show in a smaller font (setAttribute(style,font-size, etc))

And finish styling it.
